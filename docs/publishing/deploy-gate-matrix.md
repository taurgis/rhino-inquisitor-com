# Deploy gate matrix optimization

## Change summary

`deploy-pages.yml` previously ran five separate, near-identical gate jobs
(`gate_url`, `gate_seo`, `gate_a11y`, `gate_security`, `gate_perf`). They were
consolidated into a single matrixed `gates` job, and per-job setup was trimmed.

## Old vs new behavior

| Aspect | Old | New |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Gate jobs | 5 hand-copied jobs (~170 lines) | 1 `gates` job with `strategy.matrix` over `url`, `seo`, `security`, `a11y`, `perf` |
| Playwright install | Installed in every gate job **and** `build_site` | Installed only for `a11y` and `perf` (matrix `browser: true`) — the only groups whose gates drive a browser |
| Playwright browsers | Re-downloaded every run | Cached at `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, keyed on `package-lock.json` |
| Dependency cache | Cached `~/.npm` **and** `node_modules` | Caches `~/.npm` only (`npm ci` deletes `node_modules`, so restoring it was wasted I/O) |
| Dead config | `CANONICAL_PRODUCTION_BASE_URL` env declared but unused | Removed (the gate runner hardcodes its own canonical base URL) |
| Shared setup | Node setup + npm cache + `npm ci` hand-copied per job | Extracted to composite action `.github/actions/setup-node-env` |
| Perf gate Chrome | LHCI launched Playwright Chromium with the default sandbox → `No usable sandbox!` on Ubuntu runners | `lighthouserc.json` collect settings now pass `chromeFlags: "--no-sandbox --disable-dev-shm-usage"` |

Gate coverage, ordering guarantees, and the deploy contract are unchanged:
`deploy` still depends on `build_site` + all gate legs, and the official
`configure-pages` → `upload-pages-artifact` → `deploy-pages` triple with
`concurrency: { group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false }` is preserved.

## Impact and verification

- Impacted workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- Gate logic itself is untouched — the browser-need split was verified against
  `scripts/gates/run-all-gates.sh` group assignments (only `check:accessibility`
  and `check:perf:gate` load Playwright/LHCI).
- **Action required after merge:** branch-protection required status checks
  changed name from `gate_url` / `gate_seo` / … to `gate (url)` / `gate (seo)` /
  `gate (security)` / `gate (a11y)` / `gate (perf)`. Update the required checks in
  repository Settings → Branches, or protection will stop enforcing them.
- Verify by opening the next `main` deploy run: confirm the five matrix legs
  appear, `url`/`seo`/`security` skip the Playwright install step, and `deploy`
  runs only after all legs pass.
