# Deploy gate matrix optimization

## Change summary

`deploy-pages.yml` previously ran five separate, near-identical gate jobs
(`gate_url`, `gate_seo`, `gate_a11y`, `gate_security`, `gate_perf`). They were
consolidated into a single matrixed `gates` job, and per-job setup was trimmed.

## Old vs new behavior

| Aspect | Old | New |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Gate jobs | 5 hand-copied jobs (~170 lines) | 1 `gates` job with `strategy.matrix` over `url`, `seo`, `security`, `a11y`, `perf` |
| Playwright install | Installed in every gate job **and** `build_site` | Installed only for `a11y` and `perf` (matrix `browser: true`) — the only groups whose gates drive a browser |
| Playwright browsers | Re-downloaded every run | Cached at `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, keyed on `package-lock.json` |
| Dependency cache | Cached `~/.npm` **and** `node_modules` | Caches `~/.npm` only (`npm ci` deletes `node_modules`, so restoring it was wasted I/O) |
| Dead config | `CANONICAL_PRODUCTION_BASE_URL` env declared but unused | Removed (the gate runner hardcodes its own canonical base URL) |
| Shared setup | Node setup + npm cache + `npm ci` hand-copied per job | Extracted to composite action `.github/actions/setup-node-env` |
| Perf gate Chrome | LHCI launched Playwright Chromium with the default sandbox → `No usable sandbox!` on Ubuntu runners | `lighthouserc.json` collect settings now pass `chromeFlags: "--no-sandbox --disable-dev-shm-usage"` |

Gate coverage, ordering guarantees, and the deploy contract are unchanged:
`deploy` still depends on `build_site` + all gate legs, and the official
`configure-pages` → `upload-pages-artifact` → `deploy-pages` triple with
`concurrency: { group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false }` is preserved.

## Impact and verification

- Impacted workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- Gate logic itself is untouched — the browser-need split was verified against
  `scripts/gates/run-all-gates.sh` group assignments (only `check:accessibility`
  and `check:perf:gate` load Playwright/LHCI).
- **Action required after merge:** branch-protection required status checks
  changed name from `gate_url` / `gate_seo` / … to `gate (url)` / `gate (seo)` /
  `gate (security)` / `gate (a11y)` / `gate (perf)`. Update the required checks in
  repository Settings → Branches, or protection will stop enforcing them.
- Verify by opening the next `main` deploy run: confirm the five matrix legs
  appear, `url`/`seo`/`security` skip the Playwright install step, and `deploy`
  runs only after all legs pass.

## Follow-up: perf gate CLS blocker

After the matrix change the perf gate ran successfully but failed its Lighthouse
assertion: `/category/ai/` scored a mobile median of 0.76 (runs 0.97, 0.76, 0.76)
against `categories:performance minScore 0.9`. Cause was intermittent Cumulative
Layout Shift (0.52 on the slow run) from the preloaded above-the-fold web fonts
swapping in just after first paint and reflowing the LCP description paragraph.

Fix: the two preloaded above-the-fold `@font-face` faces (`Public Sans` 400 and
`Newsreader` 600) in `src/assets/styles/fragments/fonts.css` switched from
`font-display: swap` to `font-display: optional`. Paired with the existing
`<link rel="preload">`, this keeps the ~100ms block window and never swaps
afterwards, so a late font load cannot reflow the page. Verified locally: three
mobile runs on `/category/ai/` now score 0.97 with CLS 0.000.

Trade-off: on very slow connections the web font may not paint for that page load
(falls back to the system stack) instead of swapping in late. Acceptable given the
faces are preloaded and small.
