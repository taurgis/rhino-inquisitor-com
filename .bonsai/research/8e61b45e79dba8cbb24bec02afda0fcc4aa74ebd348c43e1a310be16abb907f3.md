## Property Details

### baskets

- baskets: [List] `(read-only)`
  - :

    Retrieve all open baskets for the logged in customer including the temporary baskets.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: The returned list contains all agent baskets created with
    [createAgentBasket()] and the current storefront basket which can also be retrieved with
    [getCurrentBasket()]. This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission
    Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

***

### currentBasket

- currentBasket: [Basket] `(read-only)`
  - : This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or `null` if no current valid
    basket exists.

    The methods [getCurrentBasket()] and [getCurrentOrNewBasket()] work based on the selected basket
    persistence, which can be configured in the Business Manager site preferences / baskets section. A basket is
    valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. Instead, retrieve baskets via `GET baskets/{basketId}` or
    `GET customers/{customerId}/baskets`. Do not use [getCurrentOrNewBasket()] for basket creation
    in any scenario.

    The current basket, if one exists, is usually updated by the method. In particular the last-modified date is
    updated. ***No update is done when method [getCurrentBasket()] is used within a read-only hook
    implementation (such as a beforeGet or a modifyResponse hook).*** The lifetime of a basket can be extended
    in 2 ways:

    - The basket is modified in some way, e.g. a product is added resulting in the basket total being newly  calculated. This results in the basket lifetime being reset.

    - The basket has not been modified for 60 minutes, then using this method to access the basket will also reset  the basket lifetime.

    What happens when a customer logs in? Personal data held inside the basket such as addresses, email addresses and
    payment settings is associated with the customer to whom the basket belongs. If the basket being updated belongs
    to a different customer this data is removed. This happens when a guest customer that has a basket logs in and
    hence identifies as a registered customer. In this case the basket which was previously created by the guest
    customer gets transferred to the (now logged in) registered customer. Should the registered customer already have
    a basket, this basket is effectively invalidated, but made available using [getStoredBasket()] allowing
    the script to merge content from it if desired.

    What happens when a customer logs out or when the customer session times out? After the customer logs out, a
    basket belonging to the registered customer (now logged out) is stored (where applicable) and this method
    returns `null`. Personal data is also cleared when the session times out for a guest customer.

    The following personal data is cleared:

    - product line items that were added from a wish list
    - shipping method
    - coupon line items
    - gift certificate line items
    - billing and shipping addresses
    - payment instruments
    - buyer email

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()].

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket();
    if (basket) {
        // do something with basket
    }
    ```

    Constraints:

    - The method only accesses the basket for the session customer, an exception is thrown when the session  customer is `null`.
    - Method [getCurrentOrNewBasket()]only creates a basket when method [getCurrentBasket()]returns  `null`.

***

### currentOrNewBasket

- currentOrNewBasket: [Basket] `(read-only)`
  - :

    This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or creates a new one if no current valid
    basket exists. See [getCurrentBasket()] for more details.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. For these scenarios, create baskets via `POST baskets` REST calls.

***

### storedBasket

- storedBasket: [Basket] `(read-only)`
  - :

    This method returns the stored basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. A stored
    basket is returned in the following situation:

    1. During one visit, a customer-Q logs in and creates a basket-A by adding products to it.
    2. During a subsequent visit, a second basket-B is created for a guest customer who then logs in as   customer-Q.

    In this case, basket-B is reassigned to customer-Q and basket-A is accessible as the stored basket using this
    method. It is now possible to merge the information from the stored basket (basket-A) to the active basket
    (basket-B). If this method returns `null` in the previous scenario, verify that:

    1. The session handling between the two visits is correct - the first visit and second visit must be in   different sessions. Furthermore, the second session must contain both basket creations: as guest and the customer   login.

    2. The stored basket is not expired.

    3. Basket persistence settings are configured correctly in the Business Manager.

    A stored basket exists only if the corresponding setting is selected in Business Manager. preferences' baskets
    section. A basket is valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var currentBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentOrNewBasket();
    var storedBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getStoredBasket();
    if (storedBasket) {
        // transfer all the data needed from the stored to the active basket
    }
    ```

    A exhaustive example on how to use this method in the context of the Merge Basket functionality can be found
    here: [Merge Basket utility
    functions using Script API](https://gist.github.com/sf-thomas-loesche/3446c7d71a97e559bf1caee96ae56d9f)

***

### temporaryBaskets

- temporaryBaskets: [List] `(read-only)`
  - : Retrieve all open temporary baskets for the logged in customer.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

***

## Method Details

### createAgentBasket()

- static createAgentBasket(): [Basket]
  - : Creates a new agent basket for the current session customer.

    By default only 4 open agent baskets are allowed per customer. If this is exceeded a
    [CreateAgentBasketLimitExceededException] will be thrown.

    This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no
    customer is logged in the session.

    **Returns:**

    - the newly created basket for the customer which is logged in

    **Throws:**

    - CreateAgentBasketLimitExceededException - indicates that no agent basket could be created because the agent              basket limit is already exceeded

***

### createBasketFromOrder(Order)

- static createBasketFromOrder(order: [Order]): [Basket]
  - :

    Creates a Basket from an existing Order for the purposes of changing an Order. When an Order is later created
    from the Basket, the original Order is changed to status [Order.ORDER_STATUS_REPLACED]. Restricted
    to agent scenario use cases.

    In case a storefront customer is using it the created storefront basket cannot be retrieved via

    - [getCurrentBasket()](ScriptAPI),
    - GET /baskets/<basketid>(REST APIs) or
    - DELETE /baskets/<basketid>(REST APIs) or
    - GetBasket (Pipelet) or
    - Basket-related CSC Operations from BM (these also use OCAPI REST API).

    Baskets containing an "orderNumberBeingEdited" are explicitly excluded from the list of baskets that can be
    retrieved. Responsible for this behavior (this kind of basket cannot be used as general purpose shopping baskets)

    - see [Basket.getOrderNoBeingEdited()] / [Basket.getOrderBeingEdited()].

    In case a Business Manager user is logged in into the session the basket will be marked as an agent basket. See
    [Basket.isAgentBasket()]\</>.

    Any inventory reservation associated with the order will be canceled either early when
    [Basket.reserveInventory()] is called for the new basket or (later) when a new replacement order
    is created from the basket. Consider reserving the basket following its creation.

    The method only succeeds for an Order

    - without gift certificates,
    - status is not cancelled,
    - was not previously replaced and
    - was not previously exported.

    Failures are indicated by throwing an APIException of type CreateBasketFromOrderException which provides one of
    these errorCodes:

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_CONTAINS_GC]- the Order contains a gift certificate and  cannot be replaced.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_REPLACED]- the Order was already replaced.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_CANCELLED]- the Order was cancelled.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_EXPORTED]- the Order has already been  exported.

    Usage:

    ```
    var order : Order; // known
    try
    {
      var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.createBasketFromOrder(order);
    }
    catch (e)
    {
      if (e instanceof APIException && e.type === 'CreateBasketFromOrderException')
      {
        // handle e.errorCode
      }
    }
    ```

    **Parameters:**

    - order - Order to create a Basket for

    **Returns:**

    - a new Basket

    **Throws:**

    - dw\.order.CreateBasketFromOrderException - indicates the Order is in an invalid state.

    **See Also:**

    - [AgentUserMgr.loginAgentUser(String, String)]
    - [AgentUserMgr.loginOnBehalfOfCustomer(Customer)]

***

### createTemporaryBasket()

- static createTemporaryBasket(): [Basket]
  - : Creates a new temporary basket for the current session customer. Temporary baskets are separate from shopper
    storefront and agent baskets, and are intended for use to perform calculations or create an order without
    disturbing a shopper's open storefront basket. Temporary baskets are automatically deleted after a time duration
    of 15 minutes.

    By default only 4 open temporary baskets are allowed per customer. If this is exceeded a
    [CreateTemporaryBasketLimitExceededException] will be thrown.

    **Returns:**

    - the newly created basket for the current session customer

***

### deleteBasket(Basket)

- static deleteBasket(basket: [Basket]): void
  - : Remove a customer basket including a temporary basket.

    This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no
    customer is logged in the session.

    **Parameters:**

    - basket - the basket to be removed

    **See Also:**

    - [AgentUserMgr.loginAgentUser(String, String)]
    - [AgentUserMgr.loginOnBehalfOfCustomer(Customer)]

***

### deleteTemporaryBasket(Basket)

- static deleteTemporaryBasket(basket: [Basket]): void
  - : Remove a customer temporary basket.

    **Parameters:**

    - basket - the temporary basket to be removed

***

### getBasket(String)

- static getBasket(uuid: [String]): [Basket]
  - : This method returns a valid basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. This method can
    also be used to get a temporary basket for the session customer.

    If the basket does not belong to the session customer, the method returns `null`.

    If the registered customer is not logged in, the method returns `null`.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: This method will result in an exception if called by a user without
    permission Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    The basket, if accessible, is usually updated in the same way as [getCurrentBasket()].

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()].

    **Parameters:**

    - uuid - the id of the requested basket.

    **Returns:**

    - the basket or `null`

***

### getBaskets()

- static getBaskets(): [List]
  - :

    Retrieve all open baskets for the logged in customer including the temporary baskets.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: The returned list contains all agent baskets created with
    [createAgentBasket()] and the current storefront basket which can also be retrieved with
    [getCurrentBasket()]. This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission
    Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

    **Returns:**

    - all open baskets

***

### getCurrentBasket()

- static getCurrentBasket(): [Basket]
  - : This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or `null` if no current valid
    basket exists.

    The methods [getCurrentBasket()] and [getCurrentOrNewBasket()] work based on the selected basket
    persistence, which can be configured in the Business Manager site preferences / baskets section. A basket is
    valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. Instead, retrieve baskets via `GET baskets/{basketId}` or
    `GET customers/{customerId}/baskets`. Do not use [getCurrentOrNewBasket()] for basket creation
    in any scenario.

    The current basket, if one exists, is usually updated by the method. In particular the last-modified date is
    updated. ***No update is done when method [getCurrentBasket()] is used within a read-only hook
    implementation (such as a beforeGet or a modifyResponse hook).*** The lifetime of a basket can be extended
    in 2 ways:

    - The basket is modified in some way, e.g. a product is added resulting in the basket total being newly  calculated. This results in the basket lifetime being reset.

    - The basket has not been modified for 60 minutes, then using this method to access the basket will also reset  the basket lifetime.

    What happens when a customer logs in? Personal data held inside the basket such as addresses, email addresses and
    payment settings is associated with the customer to whom the basket belongs. If the basket being updated belongs
    to a different customer this data is removed. This happens when a guest customer that has a basket logs in and
    hence identifies as a registered customer. In this case the basket which was previously created by the guest
    customer gets transferred to the (now logged in) registered customer. Should the registered customer already have
    a basket, this basket is effectively invalidated, but made available using [getStoredBasket()] allowing
    the script to merge content from it if desired.

    What happens when a customer logs out or when the customer session times out? After the customer logs out, a
    basket belonging to the registered customer (now logged out) is stored (where applicable) and this method
    returns `null`. Personal data is also cleared when the session times out for a guest customer.

    The following personal data is cleared:

    - product line items that were added from a wish list
    - shipping method
    - coupon line items
    - gift certificate line items
    - billing and shipping addresses
    - payment instruments
    - buyer email

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()].

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket();
    if (basket) {
        // do something with basket
    }
    ```

    Constraints:

    - The method only accesses the basket for the session customer, an exception is thrown when the session  customer is `null`.
    - Method [getCurrentOrNewBasket()]only creates a basket when method [getCurrentBasket()]returns  `null`.

    **Returns:**

    - the current basket or `null` if no valid current basket exists.

***

### getCurrentOrNewBasket()

- static getCurrentOrNewBasket(): [Basket]
  - :

    This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or creates a new one if no current valid
    basket exists. See [getCurrentBasket()] for more details.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. For these scenarios, create baskets via `POST baskets` REST calls.

    **Returns:**

    - the basket, existing or newly created

***

### getStoredBasket()

- static getStoredBasket(): [Basket]
  - :

    This method returns the stored basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. A stored
    basket is returned in the following situation:

    1. During one visit, a customer-Q logs in and creates a basket-A by adding products to it.
    2. During a subsequent visit, a second basket-B is created for a guest customer who then logs in as   customer-Q.

    In this case, basket-B is reassigned to customer-Q and basket-A is accessible as the stored basket using this
    method. It is now possible to merge the information from the stored basket (basket-A) to the active basket
    (basket-B). If this method returns `null` in the previous scenario, verify that:

    1. The session handling between the two visits is correct - the first visit and second visit must be in   different sessions. Furthermore, the second session must contain both basket creations: as guest and the customer   login.

    2. The stored basket is not expired.

    3. Basket persistence settings are configured correctly in the Business Manager.

    A stored basket exists only if the corresponding setting is selected in Business Manager. preferences' baskets
    section. A basket is valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var currentBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentOrNewBasket();
    var storedBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getStoredBasket();
    if (storedBasket) {
        // transfer all the data needed from the stored to the active basket
    }
    ```

    A exhaustive example on how to use this method in the context of the Merge Basket functionality can be found
    here: [Merge Basket utility
    functions using Script API](https://gist.github.com/sf-thomas-loesche/3446c7d71a97e559bf1caee96ae56d9f)

    **Returns:**

    - the stored basket or `null` if no valid stored basket exists.

***

### getTemporaryBasket(String)

- static getTemporaryBasket(uuid: [String]): [Basket]
  - : This method returns a valid temporary basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found.

    If the basket does not belong to the session customer, the method returns `null`.

    If the basket is not a temporary basket, the method returns `null`.

    The basket, if accessible, is usually updated in the same way as [getCurrentBasket()].

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()].

    **Parameters:**

    - uuid - the id of the requested temporary basket.

    **Returns:**

    - the temporary basket or `null`

***

### getTemporaryBaskets()

- static getTemporaryBaskets(): [List]
  - : Retrieve all open temporary baskets for the logged in customer.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

    **Returns:**

    - all open temporary baskets

## Property Details

### baskets

- baskets: [List](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.util.List.md) `(read-only)`
  - :

    Retrieve all open baskets for the logged in customer including the temporary baskets.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: The returned list contains all agent baskets created with
    [createAgentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#createagentbasket) and the current storefront basket which can also be retrieved with
    [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket). This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission
    Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

***

### currentBasket

- currentBasket: [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md) `(read-only)`
  - : This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or `null` if no current valid
    basket exists.

    The methods [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) and [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket) work based on the selected basket
    persistence, which can be configured in the Business Manager site preferences / baskets section. A basket is
    valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. Instead, retrieve baskets via `GET baskets/{basketId}` or
    `GET customers/{customerId}/baskets`. Do not use [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket) for basket creation
    in any scenario.

    The current basket, if one exists, is usually updated by the method. In particular the last-modified date is
    updated. ***No update is done when method [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) is used within a read-only hook
    implementation (such as a beforeGet or a modifyResponse hook).*** The lifetime of a basket can be extended
    in 2 ways:

    - The basket is modified in some way, e.g. a product is added resulting in the basket total being newly  calculated. This results in the basket lifetime being reset.

    - The basket has not been modified for 60 minutes, then using this method to access the basket will also reset  the basket lifetime.

    What happens when a customer logs in? Personal data held inside the basket such as addresses, email addresses and
    payment settings is associated with the customer to whom the basket belongs. If the basket being updated belongs
    to a different customer this data is removed. This happens when a guest customer that has a basket logs in and
    hence identifies as a registered customer. In this case the basket which was previously created by the guest
    customer gets transferred to the (now logged in) registered customer. Should the registered customer already have
    a basket, this basket is effectively invalidated, but made available using [getStoredBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getstoredbasket) allowing
    the script to merge content from it if desired.

    What happens when a customer logs out or when the customer session times out? After the customer logs out, a
    basket belonging to the registered customer (now logged out) is stored (where applicable) and this method
    returns `null`. Personal data is also cleared when the session times out for a guest customer.

    The following personal data is cleared:

    - product line items that were added from a wish list
    - shipping method
    - coupon line items
    - gift certificate line items
    - billing and shipping addresses
    - payment instruments
    - buyer email

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#updatecurrency).

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket();
    if (basket) {
        // do something with basket
    }
    ```

    Constraints:

    - The method only accesses the basket for the session customer, an exception is thrown when the session  customer is `null`.
    - Method [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket)only creates a basket when method [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket)returns  `null`.

***

### currentOrNewBasket

- currentOrNewBasket: [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md) `(read-only)`
  - :

    This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or creates a new one if no current valid
    basket exists. See [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) for more details.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. For these scenarios, create baskets via `POST baskets` REST calls.

***

### storedBasket

- storedBasket: [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md) `(read-only)`
  - :

    This method returns the stored basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. A stored
    basket is returned in the following situation:

    1. During one visit, a customer-Q logs in and creates a basket-A by adding products to it.
    2. During a subsequent visit, a second basket-B is created for a guest customer who then logs in as   customer-Q.

    In this case, basket-B is reassigned to customer-Q and basket-A is accessible as the stored basket using this
    method. It is now possible to merge the information from the stored basket (basket-A) to the active basket
    (basket-B). If this method returns `null` in the previous scenario, verify that:

    1. The session handling between the two visits is correct - the first visit and second visit must be in   different sessions. Furthermore, the second session must contain both basket creations: as guest and the customer   login.

    2. The stored basket is not expired.

    3. Basket persistence settings are configured correctly in the Business Manager.

    A stored basket exists only if the corresponding setting is selected in Business Manager. preferences' baskets
    section. A basket is valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var currentBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentOrNewBasket();
    var storedBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getStoredBasket();
    if (storedBasket) {
        // transfer all the data needed from the stored to the active basket
    }
    ```

### createBasketFromOrder(Order)

- static createBasketFromOrder(order: [Order](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Order.md)): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - :

    Creates a Basket from an existing Order for the purposes of changing an Order. When an Order is later created
    from the Basket, the original Order is changed to status [Order.ORDER_STATUS_REPLACED](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Order.md#order_status_replaced). Restricted
    to agent scenario use cases.

    In case a storefront customer is using it the created storefront basket cannot be retrieved via

    - [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket)(ScriptAPI),
    - GET /baskets/<basketid>(REST APIs) or
    - DELETE /baskets/<basketid>(REST APIs) or
    - GetBasket (Pipelet) or
    - Basket-related CSC Operations from BM (these also use OCAPI REST API).

    Baskets containing an "orderNumberBeingEdited" are explicitly excluded from the list of baskets that can be
    retrieved. Responsible for this behavior (this kind of basket cannot be used as general purpose shopping baskets)

    - see [Basket.getOrderNoBeingEdited()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#getordernobeingedited) / [Basket.getOrderBeingEdited()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#getorderbeingedited).

    In case a Business Manager user is logged in into the session the basket will be marked as an agent basket. See
    [Basket.isAgentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#isagentbasket)\</>.

    Any inventory reservation associated with the order will be canceled either early when
    [Basket.reserveInventory()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#reserveinventory) is called for the new basket or (later) when a new replacement order
    is created from the basket. Consider reserving the basket following its creation.

    The method only succeeds for an Order

    - without gift certificates,
    - status is not cancelled,
    - was not previously replaced and
    - was not previously exported.

    Failures are indicated by throwing an APIException of type CreateBasketFromOrderException which provides one of
    these errorCodes:

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_CONTAINS_GC](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.OrderProcessStatusCodes.md#order_contains_gc)- the Order contains a gift certificate and  cannot be replaced.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_REPLACED](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.OrderProcessStatusCodes.md#order_already_replaced)- the Order was already replaced.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_CANCELLED](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.OrderProcessStatusCodes.md#order_already_cancelled)- the Order was cancelled.

    - Code [OrderProcessStatusCodes.ORDER_ALREADY_EXPORTED](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.OrderProcessStatusCodes.md#order_already_exported)- the Order has already been  exported.

    Usage:

    ```
    var order : Order; // known
    try
    {
      var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.createBasketFromOrder(order);
    }
    catch (e)
    {
      if (e instanceof APIException && e.type === 'CreateBasketFromOrderException')
      {
        // handle e.errorCode
      }
    }
    ```

    **Parameters:**

    - order - Order to create a Basket for

    **Returns:**

    - a new Basket

    **Throws:**

    - dw\.order.CreateBasketFromOrderException - indicates the Order is in an invalid state.

### createTemporaryBasket()

- static createTemporaryBasket(): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - : Creates a new temporary basket for the current session customer. Temporary baskets are separate from shopper
    storefront and agent baskets, and are intended for use to perform calculations or create an order without
    disturbing a shopper's open storefront basket. Temporary baskets are automatically deleted after a time duration
    of 15 minutes.

    By default only 4 open temporary baskets are allowed per customer. If this is exceeded a
    [CreateTemporaryBasketLimitExceededException](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.CreateTemporaryBasketLimitExceededException.md) will be thrown.

    **Returns:**

    - the newly created basket for the current session customer

### getBasket(String)

- static getBasket(uuid: [String](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/TopLevel.String.md)): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - : This method returns a valid basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. This method can
    also be used to get a temporary basket for the session customer.

    If the basket does not belong to the session customer, the method returns `null`.

    If the registered customer is not logged in, the method returns `null`.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: This method will result in an exception if called by a user without
    permission Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    The basket, if accessible, is usually updated in the same way as [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket).

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#updatecurrency).

    **Parameters:**

    - uuid - the id of the requested basket.

    **Returns:**

    - the basket or `null`

***

### getBaskets()

- static getBaskets(): [List](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.util.List.md)
  - :

    Retrieve all open baskets for the logged in customer including the temporary baskets.

    Restricted to agent scenario use cases: The returned list contains all agent baskets created with
    [createAgentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#createagentbasket) and the current storefront basket which can also be retrieved with
    [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket). This method will result in an exception if called by a user without permission
    Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of or if no customer is logged in the session.

    Please notice that baskets are invalidated after a certain amount of time and may not be returned anymore.

    **Returns:**

    - all open baskets

***

### getCurrentBasket()

- static getCurrentBasket(): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - : This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or `null` if no current valid
    basket exists.

    The methods [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) and [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket) work based on the selected basket
    persistence, which can be configured in the Business Manager site preferences / baskets section. A basket is
    valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. Instead, retrieve baskets via `GET baskets/{basketId}` or
    `GET customers/{customerId}/baskets`. Do not use [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket) for basket creation
    in any scenario.

    The current basket, if one exists, is usually updated by the method. In particular the last-modified date is
    updated. ***No update is done when method [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) is used within a read-only hook
    implementation (such as a beforeGet or a modifyResponse hook).*** The lifetime of a basket can be extended
    in 2 ways:

    - The basket is modified in some way, e.g. a product is added resulting in the basket total being newly  calculated. This results in the basket lifetime being reset.

    - The basket has not been modified for 60 minutes, then using this method to access the basket will also reset  the basket lifetime.

    What happens when a customer logs in? Personal data held inside the basket such as addresses, email addresses and
    payment settings is associated with the customer to whom the basket belongs. If the basket being updated belongs
    to a different customer this data is removed. This happens when a guest customer that has a basket logs in and
    hence identifies as a registered customer. In this case the basket which was previously created by the guest
    customer gets transferred to the (now logged in) registered customer. Should the registered customer already have
    a basket, this basket is effectively invalidated, but made available using [getStoredBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getstoredbasket) allowing
    the script to merge content from it if desired.

    What happens when a customer logs out or when the customer session times out? After the customer logs out, a
    basket belonging to the registered customer (now logged out) is stored (where applicable) and this method
    returns `null`. Personal data is also cleared when the session times out for a guest customer.

    The following personal data is cleared:

    - product line items that were added from a wish list
    - shipping method
    - coupon line items
    - gift certificate line items
    - billing and shipping addresses
    - payment instruments
    - buyer email

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#updatecurrency).

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var basket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket();
    if (basket) {
        // do something with basket
    }
    ```

    Constraints:

    - The method only accesses the basket for the session customer, an exception is thrown when the session  customer is `null`.
    - Method [getCurrentOrNewBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentornewbasket)only creates a basket when method [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket)returns  `null`.

    **Returns:**

    - the current basket or `null` if no valid current basket exists.

***

### getCurrentOrNewBasket()

- static getCurrentOrNewBasket(): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - :

    This method returns the current valid basket of the session customer or creates a new one if no current valid
    basket exists. See [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket) for more details.

    In hybrid storefront scenarios *(Phased Launch sites that utilize SFRA/SiteGenesis for some part while also
    utilizing PWA Kit or other custom headless solution for another part of the same site)*, this method must
    **NOT** be used. For these scenarios, create baskets via `POST baskets` REST calls.

    **Returns:**

    - the basket, existing or newly created

***

### getStoredBasket()

- static getStoredBasket(): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - :

    This method returns the stored basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found. A stored
    basket is returned in the following situation:

    1. During one visit, a customer-Q logs in and creates a basket-A by adding products to it.
    2. During a subsequent visit, a second basket-B is created for a guest customer who then logs in as   customer-Q.

    In this case, basket-B is reassigned to customer-Q and basket-A is accessible as the stored basket using this
    method. It is now possible to merge the information from the stored basket (basket-A) to the active basket
    (basket-B). If this method returns `null` in the previous scenario, verify that:

    1. The session handling between the two visits is correct - the first visit and second visit must be in   different sessions. Furthermore, the second session must contain both basket creations: as guest and the customer   login.

    2. The stored basket is not expired.

    3. Basket persistence settings are configured correctly in the Business Manager.

    A stored basket exists only if the corresponding setting is selected in Business Manager. preferences' baskets
    section. A basket is valid for the configured basket lifetime.

    Typical usage:

    ```
    var currentBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getCurrentOrNewBasket();
    var storedBasket : Basket = BasketMgr.getStoredBasket();
    if (storedBasket) {
        // transfer all the data needed from the stored to the active basket
    }
    ```

    A exhaustive example on how to use this method in the context of the Merge Basket functionality can be found
    here: [Merge Basket utility
    functions using Script API](https://gist.github.com/sf-thomas-loesche/3446c7d71a97e559bf1caee96ae56d9f)

    **Returns:**

    - the stored basket or `null` if no valid stored basket exists.

***

### getTemporaryBasket(String)

- static getTemporaryBasket(uuid: [String](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/TopLevel.String.md)): [Basket](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md)
  - : This method returns a valid temporary basket of the session customer or `null` if none is found.

    If the basket does not belong to the session customer, the method returns `null`.

    If the basket is not a temporary basket, the method returns `null`.

    The basket, if accessible, is usually updated in the same way as [getCurrentBasket()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.BasketMgr.md#getcurrentbasket).

    If the session currency no longer matches the basket currency, the basket currency should be updated with
    [Basket.updateCurrency()](/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-script-api/dw.order.Basket.md#updatecurrency).

    **Parameters:**

    - uuid - the id of the requested temporary basket.

    **Returns:**

    - the temporary basket or `null`
