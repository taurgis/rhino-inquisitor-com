## RHI-004 · URL Classification and Disposition Mapping

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimate:** L  
**Phase:** 1  
**Assigned to:** Migration Engineer + SEO Owner  
**Target date:** 2026-03-11  
**Created:** 2026-03-07  
**Updated:** 2026-03-07

### Goal

Assign every URL in the normalised inventory a disposition (`keep`, `merge`, `retire`) and a complete mapping record that is directly implementable on GitHub Pages. This manifest is the single source of truth consumed by Phase 4 (content migration), Phase 5 (SEO), and Phase 6 (redirect strategy).

A URL without a complete, approved mapping record is a migration risk. This ticket is done only when 100% of discovered URLs have an implementable, reviewed mapping.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `migration/url-manifest.json` exists and contains one record per URL from `migration/url-inventory.normalized.json`
- [ ] Every record has all mandatory fields: `legacy_url`, `disposition`, `target_url`, `redirect_code`, `reason`, `owner`, `priority`, `implementation_layer`, `url_class`, `source`, `has_organic_traffic`, `has_external_links`
- [ ] URL coverage is 100%: every URL in the normalised inventory appears exactly once in the manifest
- [ ] No redirect chains: every `merge` or `retire` record points directly to the final destination
- [ ] `implementation_layer` is set explicitly on every non-`keep` record: `pages-static`, `edge-cdn`, `dns`, or `none`
- [ ] All `retire` records with `has_organic_traffic: true` or `has_external_links: true` have explicit SEO owner approval documented in `reason` or Progress Log
- [ ] No `target_url` is set to the homepage as a catch-all for `retire` dispositions unless explicitly approved
- [ ] `migration/url-manifest.csv` is generated as an audit-friendly export
- [ ] All `system` and `attachment` class URLs have `retire` as default unless approved otherwise
- [ ] `scripts/classify-urls.js` is committed to drive classification output

---

### Tasks

- [ ] Apply URL class taxonomy from `analysis/plan/details/phase-1.md` to every URL in `migration/url-inventory.normalized.json`
  - [ ] `post` — from `post-sitemap.xml`
  - [ ] `page` — from `page-sitemap.xml`
    - ⚠️ **Live-site flag:** `/sample-page/` is a WordPress installation default page present in `page-sitemap.xml`. It has no migration value and should be default `retire`. Also note that several URLs in `page-sitemap.xml` look like article-type content (e.g., `/versioning-of-content-assets/`, `/can-a-isslot-element-have-a-dynamic-id/`) — verify intended content type during classification review.
  - [ ] `category` — from `category-sitemap.xml`
  - [ ] `video` — from `video-sitemap.xml`
  - [ ] `landing` — from `e-landing-page-sitemap.xml`
    - ⚠️ **Live-site flag:** The single URL in this sitemap is `/elementor-landing-page-1179/` — an Elementor test/draft page that was accidentally published. It has no descriptive content and should be treated as a default `retire` candidate unless the site owner explicitly confirms otherwise. Verify before assigning `keep`.
  - [ ] `system` — probed routes (`/wp-json/`, `/xmlrpc.php`, `/feed/`, etc.)
  - [ ] `attachment` — `?attachment_id=` and media routes
  - [ ] `pagination` — `/page/N/` routes
- [ ] Apply default dispositions per class:
  - [ ] `post` → `keep` (same path)
  - [ ] `page` → `keep` (same path)
  - [ ] `category` → `keep` by default; `merge` only with approval
  - [ ] `video` → `keep` by default; `merge` only with approval
  - [ ] `landing` → `keep` by default; `merge` only with approval
  - [ ] `system` → `retire` by default; exceptions need approval
  - [ ] `attachment` → `retire` or redirect to parent content
  - [ ] `pagination` → assess measured value; default `retire` unless criteria met
- [ ] Flag all `merge` and `retire` records with `has_organic_traffic: true` for SEO owner review
- [ ] Flag all records with `has_external_links: true` for migration owner review
- [ ] Assign `implementation_layer` for every non-`keep` record
- [ ] Run redirect chain validation: ensure no `target_url` points to another non-`keep` URL
- [ ] Generate `migration/url-manifest.json` via `scripts/classify-urls.js`
- [ ] Generate `migration/url-manifest.csv` from JSON manifest
- [ ] Validate entire manifest against schema using `zod`
- [ ] Conduct joint review with SEO owner for all `merge` and `retire` decisions with organic traffic
- [ ] Resolve all flagged records; document approval or escalation in Progress Log

### Out of Scope

- Implementing redirects in Hugo templates or CI (Phase 3 / Phase 6)
- Creating or converting content files (Phase 4)
- DNS configuration changes (Phase 7)
- Reviewing URL disposition for Phase 2+ URLs not in scope of current inventory

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| RHI-002 Done (`migration/url-inventory.normalized.json`) | Ticket | Pending |
| RHI-003 Done (canonical and URL invariant policy approved) | Ticket | Pending |
| SEO owner availability for disposition review | Access | Pending |
| Migration owner availability for approval of `retire` records with traffic | Access | Pending |

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| SEO owner review delays classification completion | Medium | High | Begin automated classification of default dispositions while awaiting review of flagged records | Migration Engineer |
| High volume of `has_organic_traffic` records requiring individual approval | Medium | Medium | Batch approve by URL class; only individual URLs with >100 clicks in 90 days need per-record review | SEO Owner |
| `implementation_layer` unclear for some redirect patterns | Medium | High | Default to `edge-cdn` for complex cases; document as Phase 2 architecture dependency | Migration Owner |
| Redirect chain validation finds circular references | Low | High | Validate manifest with script before submitting for review; fail fast on cycles | Migration Engineer |
| `attachment` URLs redirect to deleted parent content | Medium | Medium | Default to `404`; only redirect when parent content is confirmed to exist in Phase 4 manifest | Migration Engineer |

### Notes

- The field schema for `migration/url-manifest.json` is the normative reference from `analysis/plan/details/phase-1.md` §Workstream 3.
- Any URL class outside the defined taxonomy is a Phase 1 blocker until policy is defined (per phase-1.md §URL Class Taxonomy rule 1).
- Governance rules for this manifest are enforced by `.github/instructions/migration-data.instructions.md`.
- Reference: `analysis/plan/details/phase-1.md` §Workstream 3, §URL Class Taxonomy
